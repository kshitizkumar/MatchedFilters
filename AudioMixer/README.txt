            // Step1 - Read a pair of (inputwav, outputfft), convert wav to fft magnitude coefficients, and write to outputfft file
            // This will be done for training samples for all classes

            // Step2 - Read (inputwav), convert wav to fft magnitude coefficients
            // This will be done for all test samples for all classes

			To verify - correct paths in train.txt and test.txt
